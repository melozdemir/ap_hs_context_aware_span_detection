The man doesn't want to reproduce with the girl, but he does want a girl who can do both. He can stay with that girl(s) until he finds a girl he is willing to reproduce with. \nAn example of this is you can find many post on reddit about nonwhite women who dated a white man in the business world, and they broke up when the guy says something along the lines of \"you are holding me back because of your race, I need to move on to move up\" \n\nThe majority of white men marry white women. For a fun fact the only group with a lower divorce rate then two whites, is white men with black women. While not something supported here that strongly, it should be acknowledged.

Black people were the ones who captured, enslaved and sold their fellow black people to American and European slavers in the first place. There would be no supply of slaves without Africans capturing their fellow Africans and selling them as slaves.", "reply": "Because White countries are generally successful - even their colonies and offshoots, and the overwhelming majority of predominantly black nations are poverty stricken shitholes. Same with cities here in the US, the biggest crime ridden, violent, and broke cities are often those in predominantly black areas with black politicians up and down the city government. It’s not a race issue, it’s a culture issue. But instead of focusing on the systemic problems within black, Hispanic, or Arab communities that keep people down and create toxic environments, they blame whitey because of the actions of leaders and politicians tens to hundreds of years ago as a way to explain the problems away without addressing the real cause. Although I believe that racism was a serious problem back in the day, there is no excuse in our modern era as to why a PoC is any less off than a white person in the same exact situation other than their culture which includes their upbringing and personally mentality, and the mentality of those in their community. Not saying there is no racism in the world because that’s stupid to say, but culture is the problem not race. \n\nGangs, absent fathers, crime are all consequences of cultures that allow, encourage, and may even idolize it. Take a look at much of the rap music today and in the past which many young kids with impressionable minds are exposed to on a daily basis. Also, rappers live extravagant lifestyles and may be looked to as idols, especially in a single mother household. The ideologies that engrain principles into your mind are also at play here. \n\nAnyways back to the rant, the real problems are not from race issues, they’re culture issues. Notice how there was no mention of race in the entire second paragraph. What I described is not limited to just white, black, Hispanic, middle eastern or Asian etc. people, but the upbringings they are from and the principles what shaped their childhood. There do exists differences that predetermine traits like strength, IQ, etc between races like genetics, but those are negligible and culture has way more influence as to why blacks are over represented in the NBA and Asians in STEM. \n\nInstead of addressing and trying to fix it, politics fucks everything up as usual. Black and Hispanic communities tend to strongly vote dem, and telling these communities that they are the cause of their problems would not be very popular. I don’t believe it’s sinister, at least on the level of the everyday person who is left leaning. Rather, I think it’s that racism is a much easier way to get votes because people naturally don’t like being blamed for stuff and it’s easier to explain away your troubles on the white  man, especially since there’s historical precedent. The politicians that use that as a platform get a leg up and the situation is enflamed by a race baiting mainstream media driven by clicks and headlines that get more ad revenue. As they rise in power they have much more influence on what people think, and get the impressionable general public to espouse what they believe. Those people then go on to become teachers which only makes the problem worse as they don’t teach the fact that blacks were sold into slavery by other blacks. This goes against their core beliefs that they were mean white men and it was a global conspiracy instead of people of both races who were trying to get by in the world and make some money where opportunity sprung up, because it would be too controversial to the regressive left. \n\nSorry to talk your ear off, I kind of just went off in a tangent and couldn’t stop myself. **To answer your question succinctly, it’s a complicated problem but culture is to blame not race, and hysteria of a white patriarchy being out to get them is a way of explaining problems away while avoiding personal responsibility.

His bashing of the Arabic Gold Star parents of a fallen soldier, and the statement, (now removed, but once on his website) that there should be a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" and has even toyed with the idea of a registry. Once again, these outright bigoted statements didn't hurt Donald Trump, they helped him. \n\nHe routinely re-tweeted white nationalists. He was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. He is adored by neo-Nazis like Richard B. Spencer, a \"founder\" of the alt-right, all vehicles of extreme white rage. And again, these things didn't hurt Donald Trump, they helped him. \n\nHe whipped anxiety and fear among these non-college whites over free trade, globalism and other issues which they didn't intellectually understand. He made the most insane, flimsy and wanting of facts promises imaginable to bring their long-gone jobs back. He told them the system was rigged against him and them, that he may not accept the results of the election and you know what's coming next, these things didn't hurt Donald Trump, they helped him.\n\nSo, hell yes, white rage put Donald Trump in office. \n\nI'm not saying that the email non-scandal didn't nominally hurt Clinton. If you want to argue that she suffered the death of a 1,000 cuts and that was one of them, I agree, but that means it was but one part of her perceived baggage. Bernie Sanders severely damaged her campaign. Her general caginess and seeming pathological inability to just be transparent hurt her. And yes, her being a woman that rubbed a lot of people the wrong way hurt her. But, it was the sum of all these things and not on in particular that cost her victory.\n\nI think Comey's last minute assist may be the most relevant because we can actually see how undecideds broke heavily for Trump in the final days leading up to the election. \n\nAnd Joe Biden?

In turn, says DiAngelo, whites are infrequently challenged and have less of a tolerance to race-based stress, causing them to be hostile, guilty, defensive, or fearful when confronted.

Talking to left-leaning independents and former Obama voters during the election, there was so little enthusiasm for Clinton, and the polls back this up. \n\nThe private server scandal, Clinton foundation, and constant drip of the leaked emails were all weaknesses that wouldn't have been there for another candidate. I also believe Clinton's hawkishness on foreign policy really hurt her with the Obama coalition. \n\nAnd the last straw may have been the choice of Kaine as VP, throwing away a chance to build bridges with that younger demographic. Biden for instance, had publicly mused about choosing Warren as VP, and you could envision that being a much more compelling ticket.\n\nSo no, I don't think it's accurate at all that no other Democrat could have won.

In fact just the opposite might be true: Clinton might have been one of the few major Dem candidates who could have lost to Trump.", "reply": "I've said this a few times already, but when I said that Trump won as a result of white rage, I'm not just personally theorizing or thinking aloud. When it came to the economy, voters thought Clinton would do a better job. In the election, we saw that education, not income best predicted who voted for Trump. We say that 67% of non-college whites backed Trump, an improvement of 6% and 9% respectively from the past two elections. We e can see in the data that it wasn't necessarily economic distress driving voters toward Trump.\n\nSo, why am I saying that white rage won him the Presidency? Because his racist remarks about Judge Curiel, his racist remarks about Mexican immigrants being rapists and murderers, and his insane talk about building a wall and making Mexico pay for it didn't damage him as conventional wisdom would dictate, they helped him. His bashing of the Arabic Gold Star parents of a fallen soldier, and the statement, (now removed, but once on his website) that there should be a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" and has even toyed with the idea of a registry. Once again, these outright bigoted statements didn't hurt Donald Trump, they helped him. \n\nHe routinely re-tweeted white nationalists. He was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. He is adored by neo-Nazis like Richard B. Spencer, a \"founder\" of the alt-right, all vehicles of extreme white rage. And again, these things didn't hurt Donald Trump, they helped him. \n\nHe whipped anxiety and fear among these non-college whites over free trade, globalism and other issues which they didn't intellectually understand. He made the most insane, flimsy and wanting of facts promises imaginable to bring their long-gone jobs back. He told them the system was rigged against him and them, that he may not accept the results of the election and you know what's coming next, these things didn't hurt Donald Trump, they helped him.\n\nSo, hell yes, white rage put Donald Trump in office. \n\nI'm not saying that the email non-scandal didn't nominally hurt Clinton. If you want to argue that she suffered the death of a 1,000 cuts and that was one of them, I agree, but that means it was but one part of her perceived baggage. Bernie Sanders severely damaged her campaign. Her general caginess and seeming pathological inability to just be transparent hurt her. And yes, her being a woman that rubbed a lot of people the wrong way hurt her. But, it was the sum of all these things and not on in particular that cost her victory.\n\nI think Comey's last minute assist may be the most relevant because we can actually see how undecideds broke heavily for Trump in the final days leading up to the election. \n\nAnd Joe Biden?

{"context": "**The Lost Boys**\n\n\nThis week we watched **The Lost Boys**, which we discuss below. Next week is [The Place Beyond The Pines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=Tjes7u9Vewc), a movie that appears to be about one of my uncles. Baj will be doing that one though!\n\n**The Lost Boys**\n\nThis movie is an interesting exercise in contradictions. It's at once almost pantomiming straightness, yet is also [fantastically gay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=55&amp;v=LpuwcINDHnQ). It's a hard R movie yet has a great many childish elements that seem straight out of The Goonies. It's both almost totally forgotten, yet referenced incessentaly by later vampire fiction.\n\nAnyway, let's set up the plot: A recently divorced mom (Dianne Wiest, best known - at least to me - as the mom from Edward Scissorhands) and her two sons Sam (Corey Haim) and Michael (Jason Patric) move to 'Santa Carla' (it's Santa Cruz in all but name) to live with their mom's dad in his creepy taxidermy house. But soon Michael falls in with a bad crowd of motorcycle goons, who it turns out are vampires! They trick him into drinking their blood, and now he and his brother and the Frog brothers (two random comic book store kids) must kill the head vampire to free Michael from the terrible curse of being an immortal superpowered demi-god. THE HORROR!\n\nThis movie is so, so gay. Sam has a picture of Lob Lowe in his bedroom laying in a sexy pose exposing his abs and sings about how he 'wants a man' in the tub in falsetto, sexy sax guy on the beach gets lots of lingering shots of his muscley glistening body, the head of the vampire motorcycle gang is weirdly and passionately fixated on 'converting' Michael into 'one of them'. Considering this movie was directed by Joel Schumacher, who would go on to give us [the gayest Batman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr6gACml4h0) it's not overly surprising - but considering the period the movie comes from it's remarkable what they were able to get away with. Later in the film one of the vampires will die and spill his 'blood' all over the Frog brothers, which when they escape into the sunlight we see is actually *glitter*-   these vampires have GLITTER FOR BLOOD and no one in 1987 caught on? I guess the preformative heterosexual elements were enough to distract from all the homoerotic undertones. \n\nNext let's talk about the weird, schizophrenic tone. Some parts of the movie feel straight out of a boy's adventure novel aimed at 12 year olds, with the ability to rattle off super hero comic book trivia treated as a badass stunt or vampires being fought with squirt guns filled with only water. But at the very same time, you have almost over the top gore elements such as one of the vampires being melted in a bathtub (of holy water) and there's people constantly getting impaled through the chest on things and writhing around in agony. Apparently the movie originally started out as a kid's movie, but when Schumacher was brought in he (in addition to gaying the movie up considerably) aged up the main cast by ~4-5 years into teenagers and upped the horror content. The resulting fusion of semi-comedic boy adventurer movie with spooky scary vampire flick is certainly unique, I will grant the film that.  \n\nThis weird tone might be why it's so fondly remembered among vampire aficionados, but is almost totally forgotten among the general public. I mean just look at this film's IMDB reference sheet: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093437/movieconnections It's been referenced more times than Paul Erdos! Yet I have never once met anyone IRL who even knows this movie exists, let alone fondly remembers it. I don't expect 'tonally inconsistent kind of gay vamp film from 1987' to be on the tips of everyone's tongues in 2019, but it's like it vanished off the face of the earth or something except among a tiny handful of people. \n\nFinally, let us discuss how '80s this movie is. Because it's pretty freaking '80s. References to '60s pop culture, the outrageous fashion choices, the hair, the fact that 'punk teens' are the actual honest to goodness threat in the movie. I have no memory of the '80s at all -  not even through reruns. I grew up watching '90s reruns, and in 2000s culture so the '80s is something I've only come to know as an adult watching films from that era. Which perhaps detracts from the movie's appeal somewhat, as it seems like a film that really had its finger on the zeitgeist of that period (Sam complains bitterly about not getting to watch MTV) and thus I am unable to truly grok on an emotional level. \n\nOverall I think the film is decent. Not amazing, the first half really drags in my view. But once the vampire combat starts it becomes an okay vampire movie, if a little madcap and silly for my tastes. I wouldn't recommend this film strongly to anyone who was born after 1989, unless you're either someone keenly interested in '80s films or someone who just really loves vampires. \n\n\n**End**\n\nSo, what are everyone else's thoughts on The Lost Boys? Remember you don't need to write a 1000 word essay to contribute. Just a paragraph discussing a particular character you thought was well acted, or a particular theme you enjoyed is all you need.

{"context": "The president directed his Republican defenders to focus on substance.\n\nWhat this means:\n\nCongress on a bipartisan basis, allocated 391 million dollars to Ukraine in military and economic assistance because we deemed it in our national security interest.\n\nUkraine right now is under attack from Russian backed separatists. Ukraine is a friend; Russia is a foe. Ukraine is a democracy; Russia is a dictatorship. The United States may very well be the only thing standing between Vladimir Putin and Ukraine being completely overrun by Russia as part of Putin's fantasy to reconstruct what he views as the glory days of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn that context, Congress allocated the 391 million dollars in a bipartisan fashion. In February the administration wrote to Congress and said the aid is on the way but it never showed up. Then in May the Trump Department of Defense wrote to Congress again, and said the aid is on the way. In that letter, \"all necessary preconditions have been met by the new Ukrainian government including the implementation of anti-corruption protocols\". That was in the letter that was sent by Trump's Department of Defense in May. Yet the aide never showed up.\n\nTwice during the summer Mitch McConnell called up the Trump administration and asked where's the aide? Mitch McConnell couldn't get a good answer. Then on July 18th, at the White House, the Office of Management and Budget held a meeting, where Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney is present,  and apparently where they say the reason that Aid has not been released is at the explicit direction of the President of the United States of America.\n\nOn July 25th, one week later, we understand why. In the Presidents own words “do us a favor though” pressuring a foreign government to target an American citizen for political gain and thereby solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election while withholding this aid from a vulnerable Ukraine.\n\nThat's the substance of the matter. \n\nAll of the above statements are public knowledge and are undisputed. \n\nThe questions are: If a president can do this for personal gain and in so doing jeopardize American security then where is the line of executive powers?

It is clear that we need to revisit the approach on how best to address the problem of foreign thieves that steal and sell American inventions and products.\n\nThe problem of online piracy is too big to ignore. American intellectual property industries provide 19 million high-paying jobs and account for more than 60 percent of U.S. exports. The theft of America's intellectual property costs the U.S. economy more than $100 billion annually and results in the loss of thousands of American jobs.  Congress cannot stand by and do nothing while American innovators and job creators are under attack.\n\nThe online theft of American intellectual property is no different than the theft of products from a store.  It is illegal and the law should be enforced both in the store and online. \n\nThe Committee will continue work with both copyright owners and Internet companies to develop proposals that combat online piracy and protect America's intellectual property.  We welcome input from all organizations and individuals who have an honest difference of opinion about how best to address this widespread problem.  The Committee remains committed to finding a solution to the problem of online piracy that protects American intellectual property and innovation.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee will postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution.\n\nBe assured that as this or related matters come before the House, I will have your views in mind.\n\nFor more information on my work in Congress or to send me an electronic message, please visit the 21st District's website, http://lamarsmith.house.gov.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLamar Smith \nChairman\nCommittee on the Judiciary", "reply": "FUCK.LAMAR.SMITH (that is all)", "AP_label": 1, "HS_label": 1, "AP_span": ["FUCK"], "HS_span": ["FUCK"], "AP_target": "LAMAR.SMITH", "HS_target": "LAMAR.SMITH", "id": 56, "meta": {"post_id": "t3_oxm1c", "reply_id": "c3kxfvj", "parent_id": "c3kxexg", "subreddit": "politics", "reply_created_utc": "1327606434", "parent_created_utc": "1327606305", "reply_created_date": "2012-01-26 19:33:54", "parent_created_date": "2012-01-26 19:31:45"}}

I suspect that in some cases this is a little mutable; there may be people who have never put in the effort to learn some basic Python and get a sense for what programming is like, but would love it if they tried.

People in other countries started getting jailed because Wikileaks emails were being used as admissible evidence in courts! All of a sudden Julian Assange was accused of espionage by Obama administration, and when they couldn't get him, out of nowhere Assange was accused of a rape which allegedly happened many years ago (which he said was a fake story and a setup) and he was arrested on $1 Million bail. Michael Moore bailed him out (!), and Assange found asylum in the Ecuador Embassy where he still resides today. This was major stuff and a crazy story, but NONE of this was mentioned anywhere in our news. How suspicious is that! \n\nAnd if you think the Inauguration riots were nauseating, you should've seen how it felt watching the media fawn over Obama the same day he ordered a drone strike that killed 200 people in a hospital (which the media ignored it like it never happened). A bit of bias and disagreeable opinions is expected, but what corporate media passes as \"impartial news\" is so blatantly dishonest and obviously agenda-driven that it is frustrating.

Though no extremely drastic constituency shifts (as in later era), accelerating depolarization/dealignment and foreshadowing of things to come. Economic issues dominate over social. Racial issues increasingly rise in salience, but both parties are competitive with Blacks. \n\n1960s-2000 -Era of transition. Era begins with drastic transformations (including the sudden turn of Blacks into a solid D bloc) and ends in solidification of party system. Social issues become more prominent in determining partisan constituency. Era of the very unstable map/very Dem-leaning Massachusetts/unsolid South.\n\n2000-2030s -Era of the stable map. Reaganite conservatism dominates the heavily WWC and Southern White GOP, McGovernite economic/social liberalism dominates Dems (the party of the unmarried). GOP dominates rural areas. Any and all coalitional changes are minor, and involve the nationalization/presidentialization of the party system. [This chart](https://againstjebelallawz.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/countiespopvote.png) suggests 2000 is the first year of this party system. Party system ends in the 2030s.\n\n**Scenario 2**:\n\n1936-1976 -New Deal era. Statist economic policies are tried, but New Deal coalition of 1936 collapses and expands in multiple ways due to the weight of its own contradictions and the rise of social issues. The near-complete collapse of the New Deal coalition in 1972 foreshadows the ending of the next.\n\n1976-2016 -Neoliberal era. Party system stabilizes with Carter (no more wild shifts after him) at an accelerating pace and neoliberal policies become increasingly utilized as opposed to New Deal ones.

{"context": "Lets all take a deep breath. Many of you may want to sit down. Lincoln was not an abolitionist. Lincoln would have not banned slavery if it would have prevented Civil War. His only real main goal was to preserve the nation as he thought was hire core Constitutional duty. So.. maybe he was lying here and there to do that, who knows, but his inauguration speech was really really bad in terms of supporting this idea of Lincoln The Great Emancipator. He was not. \n\nCheck out some of his talking points:\n\n**Slavery:** Lincoln stated emphatically that he had \"...no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\n\n**Slavery in the Territories:** Lincoln asserted that nothing in the Constitution expressly said what either could or could not be done regarding slavery in the territories. He indicated his willingness to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, so long as free blacks could be protected from being kidnapped and illegally sold into slavery through its misuse.\n\n**Protection of slavery:** Lincoln explicitly stated that he had no objection to the proposed Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which had already been approved by both houses of the United States Congress. This amendment would have formally protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, and assured to each state the right to establish or repudiate it. Lincoln indicated that he thought that this right was already protected in the original Constitution, and thus that the Corwin Amendment merely reiterated what it already contained.\n\nIs that the Lincoln you were taught about in school? I knew Lincoln wanted to preserve the nation, but I didn't realize he was ready to give up on his slavery ban right from day one. Nor did I realize he support colonization (ship them back to Africa)\n\nReally the **Abolitionist Movement ** is what ended slavery and it did so primarily through The Second Great Awakening, a Northern religious movement that painted slavery as sinful and called for it's immediately removal. People like Fredrick Douglas who helped build these movements over decades are why Lincoln was FORCED to abolish slavery as a means to unify his country.\n\nI guess in many ways the South sped up the abolition of slavery because had the South had not tried to succeed Lincoln would likely have just banned slavery and offered to ship slaves somewhere other than the United States. \n\nIt was the social movement that basically scared the south into succession and forced Lincolns hand to emancipate, not the will of The Great Emancipator. \n\nLincoln was also a liberal Republican, not a conservative Republican like we have today. Lincoln was not a progressive liberal though, those were the abolitionists who had been calling for emancipation and equal rights. Lincoln wound up supporting.\n\nNow, of course, we don't really know how much misdirection Lincoln was using. He may have supported a more aggressive stance against slavery, but not at the cost of civil war and when civil war appeared it's possible he changed his tune, likely realizing the abolitionists would win in time without a civil war. \n\nLincoln deserves credit, but the Abolition Movement deserves much more credit and was the real motivating factor as well as what drove us to war. Southerns knew abolitionists were going to win and emancipate. \n\nSo.. in reality the Republican Party is not what ended slavery. The Abolition Movement is what ended slavery. Lincoln preserved the nation, but he wasn't a moral leader that made it happen. He just got caught up in a civil war and had to do something. The war started between the time he was elected and inaugurated. He had no say in it and then it was too late. I'm confident he would have backed off slavery if the south had backed down. There is also no doubt he support colonization.\n\nDemocrats were split all over the place and some were anti slavery and some pro slavery. The Republican party was the more liberal party after The Whig party folded and abolitionists went to the Republican party AND that's why it happened, not because Lincoln said so. The Southern Democratic party also popped up out of the blue because the Democratic party split on slavery. \n\nSo there were all kinds of different Democrats and Republicans were the new liberal/progressive party, but Lincoln himself was more a moderate. Lincoln was definitely not a conservative. The Southern Democrats were the conservatives. Democrats were the moderates and the legacy party and wanted to end the war and let the south succeed vs civil war. The outgoing Democratic President claimed the federal government had no authority to act against succession. Republicans were the new guys with new ideas that went against tradition, aka liberals. Abolitionists didn't have a lot of option, so they want with the Republican party and THAT is why the Republican party emancipated slaves, not because of Lincoln. He certainly helped and was perhaps our greatest political speaker and speech writer. He kind of sucked at the war part too because the North took a lot of big losses due to poor strategy, likely mostly poor generals, but the buck still stops at the President on that one.\n\nOld ideas and stick with tradition = conservative\nBeing open to new ideas = liberal\n\nThere is no perfect way to define ideologies in general terms without the full history, but that is the most basic principle that holds true today. Conservatives stick with the old ways and resist change. That was definitely the Confederacy attempting to cling to tradition. Lincoln wanted to resolve slavery, but he honestly didn't know how. The succession and civil war made his mind up for him\n\nhttps://www.history.com/topics/black-history/abolitionist-movement", "reply": "What's the point of your post?

This time overseas after President Trump spent the weekend meeting with the world’s most powerful leaders.\n\n“Do you agree,” Mr. Acosta slithered, “that it is despicable for a government to kill a journalist?”\n\nWho gave this idiot a microphone? Who gave him a press badge? Who would give this nut a minute of airtime?\n\nCNN, apparently.\n\nThe once-vaunted international television network was once known for its brave reporters who covered wars under falling bombs from inside the war zone. Once known for its fearless correspondents who went behind enemy lines to shine a bright light on evil dictators. Once known for its serious reporters who brought attention to atrocities and famine in the farthest corners of the world.\n\nNow, Jim Acosta — preening before cameras like a wounded peacock who doesn’t know his plumage has all fallen out. The only feathers left are soggy, wet and dull.\n\nYet on he preens and struts and clucks — a sad display and an embarrassment to all the other birds.\n\nMr. Acosta gets a shot at asking the leader of the free world a question. An opportunity like that is a responsibility for any real reporter. A chance to give voice to the millions and millions of Americans who will never get a shot at asking a president a question. An opportunity to shed light on some hidden injustice. An opportunity to inform and improve our body politic.\n\nAnd this ridiculous bozo asks the president whether he opposes a part-time newspaper columnist being murdered and brutally dismembered with a bone saw. Seriously?\n\nHe asked this in front of a roomful of reporters from around the world. What must those people think of America? The seriousness of our press? What a joke.\n\nBut Mr. Acosta was LIVE! At 2:30 in the morning back home! At a time of day when Public Access television is beating CNN in most markets. Oh, but the glamour of the camera!\n\nOne might be tempted to say Mr. Acosta is an embarrassment to his profession, but there is nothing professional about the guy. He is an embarrassment to village idiots.\n\nCNN should strip him of his press credentials. He should be forced to file as a registered lobbyist for the Democrat National Committee or whatever committee handles this virulent strain of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Someone needs to change his diaper and shove a pacifier in his suckling lips.\n\nResponding to this unserious nitwit, Mr. Trump answered the way a parent answers a crybaby having a temper tantrum.\n\n“Yes, I do. I think it’s horrible,” Mr. Trump replied flatly.\n\nMr. Trump has witnessed enough drama and theatrics from Jim Acosta to know what he is in for whenever Mr. Acostagets a question. Yet the president calls on him anyway.\n\nSo much for this whole ridiculous lie that Mr. Trump wants to shut down the media. He doesn’t even shut down the fake media, the true Enemy of the People. Not only that, he calls on them.\n\nLike James Madison and Thomas Jefferson before him, Mr. Trump understands that freedom can be messy. And it is best to let ludicrous loudmouths like Jim Acosta have their say, like the raving lunatic caterwauling on the street corner gets his. Best to just let the nut vent.\n\nAnd then serious people can all get on with the serious work at hand. As Mr. Acosta smears his pureed peas-and-carrots baby food all over the tray of his high chair, smiles in greasy satisfaction, passes gas into his fetid diaper and hiccups.\n\n⦁ Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.", "reply": "Holy christ what a read.\n\nThis guy writes so well, I can't remember the last time I've read an article that was so articulate with its views.", "AP_label": 0, "HS_label": 0, "AP_span": [], "HS_span": [], "AP_target": null, "HS_target": null, "id": 4625, "meta": {"post_id": "t3_c7n16u", "reply_id": "esgs519", "parent_id": "esgbz0o", "subreddit": "The_Donald", "reply_created_utc": 1561964251, "parent_created_utc": 1561948682, "reply_created_date": "2019-07-01 06:57:31", "parent_created_date": "2019-07-01 02:38:02"}}

{"context": "As /u/xxxxx mentions, anthropology has generally gone the opposite direction from this book, particularly after the 1960's and 1970's.\n\nThere are, however, some anthropologists who are willing to do both critical work and explicitly cross cultural comparative work. They often use a set sample of cultures (most commonly the [Human Relations Area Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Relations_Area_Files), but others exist). This sort of work is very marginal to contemporary anthropology, but it exists; used an HRAF-based paper to answer the question \"Is the romantic kiss universal?\" [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5xnl2o/eli5_why_is_the_sex_humans_have_so_different_from/dejwmy3/?context=3) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4c4gsz/did_people_always_make_out_how_was_attraction/), for instance.\n\nIf you're asking about whether that *finding* is true, it appears to be.  From a 1987 *Annual Review of Anthropology* article:\n\n&gt;Many cross-cultural studies have sought to define the local norms of sexual practice and discuss the cultural means by which normative behavior is maintained. Anthropologists continue to identify patte s of sexual behavior in terms of permissive and res ictive sex rules (89, 114). Frayser (132) uses HRAF data to argue that the nature of sex rules in any society is directly related to the extent to which sexual and reproductive relations overlap. Using the same data, Reiss (329) suggests that cultural scripts for high and low permissiveness stem from a linkage of marital sexuality, power relations, and an innate human tendency towards jealousy. Broude (57), however,questions the assumption that cultures can be categorized as either permissive or restrictive in their overall orientation. Less comprehensive discussions of norms and the regulation of sexual behavior tend to fall into four categories: marriage and sexuality, socialization, initiations and ceremonies, and aging.\n\n&gt;A large number of HRAF studies on premarital sexual practice exist (148, 259, 334, 389). Broude (56) has critically reviewed these and apparently agrees with Murdock's (282) conclusion that the more complex a society, the more restrictions are likely to be found involving premarital sexuality. However the details of the relationship remain unclear.\n\nAlso note this (Unwin is source number 376 in this review):\n\n&gt;Earlier cross-cultural sex research was undertaken for two widely disparate reasons. One perspective,which focused on problems of cultural evolution, suggested that early human society was typified by sexual promiscuity and group marriage (20,136,262,276,315,376). Malinowski (250,252,275) and Westermarck (390) argued against this view and the evidence for it. Other early writers perpetuated a long-standing tradition of anthropological po og­ raphy,in which cross-cultural data on sexual practice is presented to titillate a Weste  audience. Titles or publishing houses may even contain \"anthropolo­ gy,\" \"ethnography, \" or \"ethnopo ography \" in their names (11,52,61-63, 71, 198, 324,326, 355, 363). Some texts may have begun as serious works but were adulterated through many subsequent editions (e.g. 318,383).\n\nEven if Unwin's empirical finding might be right (and it's debated, as mentioned above), I think most anthropologists would argue his analysis of that finding is way off because of the assumptions he makes about cultural evolution. Also, some of his interpretations seem grossly off: was the Chinese empire (with its complex concubine system that lasted until the Communist take-over) not \"civilized\"? Or, since these were not *marriages* but *concubinages*, does that still count as \"civilized\"? What is and isn't monogamy, and what effect monogamy has or hasn't had, is its own bag of worms.\n\nDavis and Whitten end their *Annual Review* piece:\n\n&gt;This review began with the comment that anthropologists have rarely studied human sexuality. The number of sources cited may seem to belie this apprais­ al. However, the literature is widely scattered over time and among cultures. Few serious attempts have been made to bring the literature together or even to follow up on previous studies (97, 99). Typically a researcher makes a single specialized contribution to the field. Regional and topical summaries and analyses are rare. Human sexuality is not yet a coherent subspeciality of anthropology. There is need for further open discussion of human sexuality and for the development of uniquely anthropological theories of the relevant phenomena. With its cross-cultural, holistic, and relativistic approach, an­ thropology is in a singular position to attempt such analyses. Wo hy in their own right, such discussions would also serve to improve the public and professional understanding of human sexuality in general.\n\nThough some parts of the literature have received a large amount of attention (e.g. cross-cultural views of homosexuality), but, as far as I know, there has been no successful attempt to bring the literature together since then (there are small additions, like a 1997 review in the *Annual Review of Sex Research* called \"Sexuality, Culture, and Political Economy: Recent Developments in Anthropological and Cross-Cultural Sex Research\").\n\nIf you're interested in cross-cultural sex research, the best that I currently know is Gwen Broude's work. It's unfortunately all articles, all from the 1970's and 80's, none of it collated into a book (I believe it was based on her dissertation). I think she used the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample instead of HRAF (the SCCS was supplemented by HRAF in her research), but you can think of them as roughly equivalent. One of the problems, though, is that because sex often isn't explicitly looked at by anthropologists (as opposed to, say, kinship), you get a lot of missing data. There are 186 societies in the SCCS, but Broude was only about to code 40-80 societies for a lot of them because there just wasn't sufficient ethnographic data on the other hundred or so for many of the questions (some questions, like the value of female virginity, could be coded for almost all groups in the sample). If you don't have access to an academic library, you can read an [ungated version of one her articles here](http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Cross-Cultural_Codes.pdf). This article is all about coding, not correlations between the codes and other things (she explores that in other articles and book chapters), but it lets you minimally see the diversity of human behavior.\n\nI *think* this is as much of as [summary of her quantitative, cross-cultural research as Broude has ever written](http://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/media/Course_files/anth-203-barry-hewlett/broude-sex.pdf). It's a book chapter, very readable even to the non-specialist. I'm not sure exactly in what context it was prepared, when, or if any significant part of her research agenda is left out, but it's something that may interest you. (The SCCS, I believe, largely omits industrialized societies, so if you're interested in sexuality in industrialized societies, this is not necessarily the end of your search, but I thinking through her patterns, they mostly seem to continue into industrial societies.) Anyway, Broude connects things like the restrictions around pre-martial sex to customs around the transfer of property at marriage (e.g. if brides come with a large bride price, women will be discouraged from having sex with men) and the connection between kinship and social identity (e.g. if who your father is important in a culture, then there will be heavier restrictions around pre-marital sex). It's well worth your time to read. One thing to note is that she takes an evolutionary perspective at the end, while I think most other anthropologists might tend to incline towards a social constructionist or materialist explanation (she uses both types of explanations earlier in the article, particularly materialist explanations). She discusses the three perspectives more in the encyclopedia article that starts on page 177 [here](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.594.6526&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=210), where she calls them the biological (evolutionary), learning (social constructionist), and \"systematically related to other aspects of culture and behavior\" (materialist) perspectives.", "reply": "Thanks for all the material!

Getting into the mindset of being polite to siphon supporters is a waste of time, have faith in Yang's message and focus solely on that.\n\nHonestly I've been a Democrat for about 30 years. I can get behind Yang, Bernie, Harris, Warren, and Biden. This guy is a non-starter for me.

Part of being a Democrat is about speaking truth to power, that is way more important than politeness and niceness.\n\nUnder Pete in South Bend. Measured rises in child homelessness, a doubling of the eviction rate after he took office to the point where it was three times the national average because he wanted to gentrify and committed to bulldozing a 1000 homes in 1000 days and then going past that, which forced families into homelessness, the eviction crisis started in 2016 and he only got around to passing a simple ordinance to address it last month once it became news, a rise in deep poverty in the black community, protecting racist cops, a rise in murder, rape, car theft, and assault while he was in office.

He should have used the $10 million for bulldozing homes to hire people in the local community to fix up those homes and put people in them, but he wanted to gentrify that was his goal.

{"context": "**Article Text:**\n\nPresident Trump did something historic on Sunday. Before onlooking cameras and a grinning despot, he became the first U.S. president to cross the line of demarcation that separates the two Koreas.\n\nFor the former reality television host, the scene was vintage Trump. Over the past few weeks, Trump’s team teased the prospect of a third meeting since 2018 with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, possibly after the president wrapped up his visit to Japan and the Group of 20 summit. Rumors and speculation gripped the White House press corps. Then came a presidential tweet from Osaka on Saturday, where Trump indicated he would travel to the DMZ, the last frozen frontier of the Cold War, and coyly asked the despot in Pyongyang to meet him there for a handshake.\n\nKim happily obliged, achieving a feat unmatched by his father or grandfather. And so, before a bruising scrum of bodyguards and journalists, Trump strode past Panmunjom’s blue-painted compounds and got a photo op for the ages.\n\n\nThe theatrics and uncertainty of the moment cannot conceal the Trumpian pattern already at play. As my colleague David Nakamura noted, the handshake over the 38th parallel was only the latest episode of a series of “carefully cultivated elaborately staged moments” over the past two years that “reveal a president eager to play the roles of producer and director, calling the camera shots, hyping the drama, and building public expectations for a big reveal.”\n\nCritics, including leading 2020 Democratic candidates, decried the handshake as another instance of Trump coddling a dictator for no clear strategic benefit. After Trump made his historic step, the two leaders sat down for a hastily organized bilateral meeting on the South Korean side of the border. It emerged that stalled talks on North Korea’s denuclearization would resume and that Kim was likely invited for an unprecedented White House visit.\n\nBut experts pointed out that there had yet to be any meaningful progress between both sides before Trump’s appearance at the border — which was a monumental concession to a long-isolated totalitarian state. Kim wants relief from international sanctions; the White House wants to defang North Korea’s nuclear program. Neither outcome is in the cards, at least in the near term.\n\n\nDuyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, argued that the road ahead would be “tough,” contingent on a series of “piecemeal deals” and a long, arduous diplomatic process. So far, though, Trump has shown little patience and stamina for this sort of high-wire track. Instead, he prioritizes spectacle and pageantry.\n\n“They needed something that is strong on optics but weak on substance,” Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul, told my colleagues. “Substance is difficult or impossible to achieve in the available time frame, and involves such painful issues that they would like to keep pushing the can down the road.”\n\nAn encouraging sign for those of the dovish persuasion would have been the absence of Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, a hawk who decades prior worked to sabotage earlier diplomatic rounds with Pyongyang. Bolton was conspicuously in the Mongolian capital for separate meetings, while Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative to North Korea who has clashed with Bolton, was at Trump’s side.\n\n\nBut few analysts expect any real breakthroughs soon. “If this were part of a broader detente, if it followed a major agreement to limit the threat, it would be a powerful, even exhilarating moment,” observed Adam Mount of the Federation of American Scientists. “Unfortunately, this is empty pageantry for its own sake.”\n\nNevertheless, the pageantry tells its own story. “All the buildup and made-for-TV drama, however, has distracted from one salient fact: North Korea has not given up its nuclear weapons. In fact, it likely has more nuclear-weapons material now than it did a year ago, when Trump became the first American leader to meet with his North Korean counterpart,” wrote the Atlantic’s Uri Friedman. “What the fevered anticipation does underscore is that progress on North Korean denuclearization rests largely on Trump and Kim’s personal relationship—even though this dependence contributed to the collapse of their second summit, in Vietnam last February.”\n\nThis is now par for the course for Trump. The president’s agenda hinges profoundly around his own personality, celebrity and will to power; moral imperatives, political values and conventional diplomatic processes all take a back seat.\n\n\nSitting next to Kim, one of the world’s foremost human rights abusers, Trump took the time to spread falsehoods about his predecessor, former president Barack Obama. Earlier on his trip at the G-20, he joked with Russian President Vladimir Putin about election interference, no matter the assessments of his own intelligence agencies. When asked about separate remarks Putin had made attacking Western liberal values, Trump appeared to misinterpret the question, launching into a diatribe against California Democrats — the only Western liberalism that matters to a president in constant campaign mode.\n\nAnd in Trump’s theater, a familiar cast of characters always has a role to play, regardless of their qualifications. His daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, attended the session with Kim. On the sidelines of the G-20 in Japan, Ivanka issued the White House’s formal “readout” of talks with Japanese and Indian counterparts — an anodyne, platitudinous statement made only interesting by the identity of the messenger.\n\nA video released by the French government captured the awkwardness of an interaction between the president’s daughter and a number of other Western leaders possibly perplexed by her role at the major international summit.\n\n\n“The video,” wrote Ed Luce of the Financial Times, “shows varying expressions of tortured politeness as Ms Trump intrudes on a discussion between France’s Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s Theresa May, Canada’s Justin Trudeau and Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF. Ms Lagarde, in particular, was unable to conceal her irritation.”\n\nIn another era, the scene would be itself a cause for genuine consternation. Now, it’s just another episode of Trump’s never-ending reality show — and the rest of the world is getting with the program.", "reply": "Thank you.\n\nEdit.

{"context": "The research is thin on this topic, in part because it’s a relatively new phenomenon and also because despite what you might deduce from the popular press, there are simply not that many gay people. The limited research indicates that gay parents are more likely to raise gay children than heterosexual couples. \n\nhttps://borngay.procon.org/sourcefiles/TrayceHansen.pdf\n\nI think this should be intuitively obvious. Behaviors of all types in parents make it more likely that children will adopt those same behaviors. People raised in a house with democratic parents are far more likely to become democrats and people raised in a catholic house will be much more likely to be catholic etc. If it’s true that children of gay parents are more likely to be gay even if they have no genetic connection with their parents, it is problematic for people that believe that homosexuality is almost completely genetic and that environment plays little or no role in sexual orientation.\n\nSo, the question then becomes is it good, bad or indifferent if kids are more likely to be gay? Gay people suffer more often from mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, are more likely to develop substance abuse problems and are more likely to attempt suicide. Who knows if this is BECAUSE they are gay, but it’s well established that these problems are statistically much more prevalent in LGBT people. So, there is a likelihood in my opinion that if the percentage of gay parents increased dramatically, we should expect to see an increase in mental health issues, addiction and suicide which are obviously not good things. We have to balance that with alternatives, however because clearly the same risks of problems exist in children raised in foster homes and in single-parent homes.\n\nIn my opinion, it’s clear that a home with two heterosexual parents is the best place to raise children but obviously that’s not always possible.", "reply": "&gt; Gay people suffer more often from mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, are more likely to develop substance abuse problems and are more likely to attempt suicide.\n\nTo play Devil's advocate here (I genuinely haven't formed a view), many biological or social groups have these characteristics.

But me I'm thinking okay someone's probably going to take her up on that and then after she gets shot and killed black people upset by this will probably shoot a white politican and it'll keep going on from there till we get a civil war. Now why am I thinking this? Chances are there must be some event from my childhood which has created this pattern or just a story I read. Like stories are just a level of abstraction of real life. They're a prediction algorithm for chaotic systems. And the left are like these fucking stupid children that have no idea what's coming next. And maybe that's why the new Star Wars movies sucked. If you're not boiling reality down and abstracting it in a way that's likely to be of some use later on then you're not going to enjoy the story. So that's an interpretation of \"meaning\" it's not something outside of us it's the same thing as us. ie. like spinoza and the universe/nature/god is the same stuff. So a nihilist has a reduced level of predictive ability. The left are nihilists hence they suck at stories and even understanding people in general. \"so what you're saying is\"...", "reply": "&gt;So here's a current example.

There have been many black people who have been killed by white people in just the last two years, and despite that, no civil war has been started. You're view of how a civil war might start just seems to simplistic. The last part of your paragraph \"black people upset by this will probably shoot a white politician and it'll keep going on from there till we get a civil war\" is just too vague to serve as a decent analysis as to how we could possibly end up getting into a civil war from a black person shooting a white person in response to a white person killing a black person. \n\n&gt;And the left are like these stupid fucking children that have no idea what's coming next.\n\nThis a terrible view to hold of millions of people who simply don't share the same worldview as you. If I talked about the right like that on this sub, I would get flamed for it, so I'm not sure why its okay to refer to the left as \"stupid fucking children\". You're an ideologue who doesn't even realize that they're an ideologue and who views people who don't share the same worldview as you disparagingly. You are essentially talking like the biased closed minded left winger which I'm sure you hate so much. \n\n&gt;And maybe that's why the new star wars movie sucked\n\nThis is just your subjective opinion. Many people like the film, many didn't, but I'm not sure why you would even bother making this point. \n\n&gt;The left are nihilists hence they suck at stories\n\nA significant portion of left wingers are not nihilists. Given by what you said about left wingers previously in the post, you don't seem to know that much at all about left wingers. Many left wingers are religious, many don't like nihilism and find it a reprehensible ideology, and many don't even know what nihilism is. The left sucks at stories? Tell that to George Orwell, a democratic socialist who wrote novels considered to be some of the greatest of all time, like \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\". \n\nIn conclusion, you seem to hold close minded views of the people you disagree with politically. On top of that, I think that the way you expressed your self in your comment is very muddled and messy. It was difficult to even understand what you were saying sometimes. You seemed to forget to put periods to signify the end of some of your sentences and instead just started a new sentence at the end of an old one.

The Prophet replied, \"They (i.e. women and children) are from them (i.e. pagans).\" I also heard the Prophet saying, \"The institution of Hima is invalid except for Allah and His Apostle.\"\n\nIn practice, we have the [genocide and enslavement](http://www.answering-islam.org/Authors/Arlandson/qurayza_jews.htm) committed against a tribe of Jews known as the Banu Qurayza.\n\nTo summarize the atrocity against the Banu Qurayza, they were a Jewish tribe in Yathrib (now Medina) where Muhammad and his followers were in a battle with the Meccans known as the [Battle of the Trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Trench). The Qurayza wanted nothing to do with the fighting, but did provide equipment needed by the Muslims to mount a defense.\n\nAfter the battle was concluded and Yathrib was already victorious, Muhammad got word that *maybe* 2 or 3 of the leaders of the Qurayza had considered brokering a peace with the Meccans.\n\nMuhammad immediately laid siege to the Qurayza compound, and once the siege was broken he brought out all of the men and boys old enough to pubic hair (yes, that's how they picked them) in small groups and lopped all of their heads off. The total slaughtered was around 900 boys and men.\n\nThe women and children were sold into slavery, except for one women that Muhammad kept for himself as a [fuck slave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayhana_bint_Zayd). The Muslims also conveniently took possession of all of the tribe's belongings as well. Greed was also a running theme in the life of Muhammad.\n\n[Qur'an 33:21](http://quran.com/33/21) stating that Muhammad is an excellent example of how to live your life:\n\n&gt;There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often.\n\nWhat is particularly disturbing is that the vast majority of Muslims will go to great lengths to justify the heinous activities to which Muhammad subscribed on a regular basis, not the least of which were slavery, murdering those who spoke against him or his cult (especially poets), highway robbery, etc ad nauseum.\n\n&gt;why the double standard for the Islamic civilization?\n\nBecause Islam still exists and is still committing heinous acts. The Romans have been history for 1,600 years, the Persians another 900 years beyond that.\n\n&gt;Why dont you instead realize the contributions Muslims made to modern human civilization over the ages\n\nBecause their contributions didn't just shoot up a nightclub in Turkey and kill dozens of people.\n\nAre you somehow attempting to weigh the good and the bad to look for a surplus?

Those opposed to Islam do the same things for the same purposes.\n\n&gt;Ridiculous? Are Islamic terrorist acts being committed on a regular basis and all over the world? Yes, they are, is that's what's ridiculous? I think it is.\nIf you're asking if I have evidence that Islam endorses terrorist attacks - that is to say, the indiscriminate slaughter of innocents - absolutely. But I'm not who you should be worried about. I don't kill people for Islam.\nThe terrorizing of non-combatants is given divine authority in Qur'an 8:57. Note that in the context of war, those that are \"behind\" the enemy lines would be the women, children, infirm, elderly, etc:\n\nIslamic terrorism is exclusively post-WW1 modern phenomenon with political roots. There was no terrorism before the Ottoman collapse, before the British, French, and Russian invasions. These forces invaded, pillaged, conquered, and installed puppet tyrants to rule in their stead. America was last to the game in the Middle east and wanted a piece of the pie after WW2. The rest is history. \n\nNow, as for theology. Violence against non-combatants is explicitly prohibited. The verse you provided is no such evidence for your claim. (Btw, using \"Religion of peace\" as a source? Not a good look!)\n\nIn the words of the first Caliph, Abu Bakr, in his speech to the Muslim soldiers:\n\n“Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for guidance on the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies; do not kill a woman, a child, or an aged man; do not cut down fruitful trees; do not destroy inhabited areas; do not slaughter any of the enemies’ sheep, cow or camel except for food; do not burn date palms, nor inundate them; do not embezzle (e.g. no misappropriation of booty or spoils of war) nor be guilty of cowardliness…You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.\"\n\n&gt;As with all of the content of the Qur'an, context is paramount in understanding the text to meet theological legitimacy. Context for Qur'an 8:57 an be found in Bukhari :: Book 4 :: Volume 52 :: Hadith 256:\n\nThe irony is sweet. Talking about context while taking a Hadith out of context. Just look at the Hadith right after it, and even the one right after that.\n\n\"During some of the Ghazawat of the Prophet a woman was found killed. Allah's Apostle disapproved the killing of women and children.\"\n\nThe message is clear. Do not kill women and children.\n\n&gt; Banu Qurayza\n\nAh yes, the timeless story of Banu Qurayza, most loved by people with an irrational hatred for Islam and the early Muslims. \n\nThis is where knowing history is of paramount importance. The Muslims were at war with the pagans of Makkah, needed funds, needed allies. All of the Jewish tribes were cooperative, except for the Banu Qurayza, the Muslims suspected treachery. While the Muslim men were off fighting the Quraysh, the women and children were left behind in a small fortress for their safety. The Banu Qurayza were supposed to protect them, what did they do instead? They decided to attempt to kill all the Muslim women and children while the men were gone. Not only that, they sought to let in the enemy through a back passage. Fortunately, the attempt of the Bany Qurayza to kill the Muslim women was a miserable and pathetic failure, the women were able to easily fend them off until the men came back. \n\nWhen the Muslim men arrived, and found out what happened, they were angry, understandably. The Prophet Muhammad told them to choose a representative to determine their fate. The representative chose the punishment of treachery according to the Torah, that is, kill the men and spare the women and children. The women and children were placed under the care of Ibn Salam, a former chief Rabbi. \n\nSo, was the punishment of Banu Qurayza harsh? Yes. Justified? Absolutely. \n\n&gt;What is particularly disturbing is that the vast majority of Muslims will go to great lengths to justify the heinous activities to which Muhammad subscribed on a regular basis, not the least of which were slavery, murdering those who spoke against him or his cult (especially poets), highway robbery, etc ad nauseum.\n\nMore old accusations. Poets who ran their mouths were not killed. There is one famous poet who was killed, but he attempted to assassinate the Prophet Muhammad, so the death penalty for him was justified. As for \"highway robbery\", I'm assuming you are referring to the raids on the Quraysh caravans. Attacking enemy supply lines in a war is not \"highway robbery\". \n\n&gt;Because Islam still exists and is still committing heinous acts. The Romans have been history for 1,600 years, the Persians another 900 years beyond that.\n\nIslam is a religion and isnt committing any acts. Deluded and ignorant people are committing heinous acts, acts that should be condemned and dealt with swiftly and strongly. These terrorist acts, like I said before, are political in nature, a fact the FBI testifies. The Russian ambassador was killed for Islam? Or about the war in Syria? Was the nightclub in Turkey shot up for religions reasons? No. You blaming Islam for these acts make you look not very well read on basic history, post-WW1, classic, and modern. These groups kill Muslims first and foremost, and work on fear. The more you give in to the notion that terrorists represent Islam, the happier the terrorists get. \n\nIve been in these kinds of arguments millions of times over the past decade, ive said it before and ill say it again. There is only one solution to radical Islamic terrorism, and that is Islam. Real Islam. Not these modern khawarijite extremist interpretation that goes against the values of global mainstream Muslims and [global mainstream Islamic scholarship](http://www.lettertobaghdadi.com/). \n\nOf course, to actually getting around to teaching real Islam, first we have to solve the problems of war, poverty, employment, and economy etc that has plagued the region since the Ottoman collapse thanks to Western invasions and foreign meddling in Muslim governments. The Muslim world needs to be rebuilt, on a platform of universal ethics and principles. But Western governments need to first remove military presence and let it happen. The Muslim world can never rebuild itself if America is bombing the Middle east back to the stone age every few weeks.\n\nDo you understand what I mean now, when I say the situation isnt so \"black and white\"?", "AP_label": 0, "HS_label": 1, "AP_span": [], "HS_span": ["Islam commands them to do horrific shi", "commanded by Islam to do horrific shi", "Islam endorses terrorist attacks", "I don't kill people for Islam", "The terrorizing of non-combatants is given divine authority in Qur'an 8:57"], "AP_target": null, "HS_target": "Muslims", "id": 6528, "meta": {"post_id": "t3_5lf1bb", "reply_id": "dbw0nx5", "parent_id": "dbvyn1s", "subreddit": "Israel", "reply_created_utc": 1483324387, "parent_created_utc": 1483321419, "reply_created_date": "2017-01-02 02:33:07", "parent_created_date": "2017-01-02 01:43:39"}}

{"context": "&gt;Isn't that rather like an IQ test?\n\nNo.  IQ are designed to determine a person's IQ, naturally.  The IQ is supposed a single number representing and ranking a person's general intelligence.  The truth about intelligence, though, is that there is no real general intelligence.  People process information differently and therefore differ in their intellectual skill sets, which is why someone can be a genius at physics while knowing next to nothing about medicine or economics or even other parts of physics.  And this is without even touching on things like learning disorders.  So IQ tests don't test intelligence as much as they test how well one takes on IQ test, and those two things aren't the same.  So there's no way to accurately gauge an individual's overall intellect.  You can really only gauge their aptitude for specific tasks.\n\n&gt;I don't think your premise is entirely correct.  They are paid less  because there are swarms of OTHER illegals they could also hire. If  there was no illegal alien to replace the one hired then they could  demand more money until they become competitive to the legal pool of  labor.\n\nThe only reason they're so easily replaced is because their employers can (and often do) simply call the cops on them when their ready for employee turnover.  Also, the other illegals work for ultra-low wages for the same reasons the first group of illegals do.\n\n&gt;\"Ah\" you may think, so let's make them legal and that will solve  the problem.  Doesn't stand to reason or we wouldn't have the illegals  here in the first place.  That is why stopping the influx of illegals is  the solution.\n\nWe would have illegals here in the first place, because they're not just here to work.  They're mainly here to escape the harsh, often life-threaten conditions in their home countries, which were quite often exacerbated by US foreign policy somewhere along the way.\n\nBy the way, you're not going to stop immigration or get rid of the existing undocumented population without a police state.  And you're definitely not stopping mass immigration without stopping the First World from continuing to destroy the Second and Third Worlds.\n\n&gt;But overall the cheapness of labor is dependent on the supply of that  labor.  The same pro-business GOP-types wanting illegals now are just as  happy with more legal immigrants and openly state it.\n\nI don't know of any Republican or conservative who wants more illegals.  All the ones I've met in my life share your hatred for them.\n\n&gt;The price of  labor will be the same eventually so everyone will be paid the wages of  illegals now.\n\nAnd yet the vast, *vast* majority of workers, even those that are grossly underpaid, don't make anywhere near as little as illegal immigrant labor, nor would they ever accept as little.  That's because they don't have the threat of deportation hanging over their heads.\n\n&gt;If you have an oversupply of labor it doesn't matter if  they are legal or not, your chances of a union being effective are  minimal.\n\nNo only are you wrong about that, but illegal immigrants, with groups like the IWW's help (by fighting for their rights and by organizing against the pigs), are as essential to that struggle as any other group of workers.  That's why the IWW organizes workers *as a single class*.\n\n&gt;Only problem with your statement is the ones opposing this oppose the  immigrants being here to BE THE TOOLS OF CAPITALISTS in the first place.\n\nThat's very much a minority viewpoint.  The majority viewpoint, as far as I've personally observed, is \"fuck immigrants\".  No one I've debated about this, including you, has said anything regarding the exploitation of immigrants until being forced to adopted such rhetoric as a strategy to try to salvage the debate.  In fact, this is the first you've acknowledged them at all as victims of an economic injustice.  If you really gave a shit, you would've brought it up way earlier.\n\n&gt;Proof that opposing immigration is a great tool to oppose the ills of  capitalism you seem to object to.\n\nYou've proved nothing of the sort.\n\n&gt;Then you will only average your quality of life with a billion people  living on dirt floors.

So legal employees can't just be....fired?  Why would they need to call the cops?  Just fire them like any legal employee.  That is CERTAINLY true in any \"right to work\" state.  Maybe you are in one where they actually have to come up with a reason?  Usually that isn't much of a hindrance.  So my point stands and what you bring up is irrelevant as far as I can tell.\n\n&gt;By the way, you're not going to stop immigration or get rid of the existing undocumented population without a police state.\n\nYou said it.

{"context": "But Trump didn't win only thanks to 'white rage' -- it required a collapse of Democratic turnout.

When it came to the economy, voters thought Clinton would do a better job. In the election, we saw that education, not income best predicted who voted for Trump. We say that 67% of non-college whites backed Trump, an improvement of 6% and 9% respectively from the past two elections. We e can see in the data that it wasn't necessarily economic distress driving voters toward Trump. So, why am I saying that white rage won him the Presidency? Because his racist remarks about Judge Curiel, his racist remarks about Mexican immigrants being rapists and murderers, and his insane talk about building a wall and making Mexico pay for it didn't damage him as conventional wisdom would dictate, they helped him. His bashing of the Arabic Gold Star parents of a fallen soldier, and the statement, (now removed, but once on his website) that there should be a 'total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States' and has even toyed with the idea of a registry. Once again, these outright bigoted statements didn't hurt Donald Trump, they helped him. He routinely re-tweeted white nationalists. He was endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan. He is adored by neo-Nazis like Richard B. Spencer, a 'founder' of the alt-right, all vehicles of extreme white rage. And again, these things didn't hurt Donald Trump, they helped him. He whipped anxiety and fear among these non-college whites over free trade, globalism and other issues which they didn't intellectually understand. He made the most insane, flimsy and wanting of facts promises imaginable to bring their long-gone jobs back. He told them the system was rigged against him and them, that he may not accept the results of the election and you know what's coming next, these things didn't hurt Donald Trump, they helped him. So, hell yes, white rage put Donald Trump in office. I'm not saying that the email non-scandal didn't nominally hurt Clinton. If you want to argue that she suffered the death of a 1,000 cuts and that was one of them, I agree, but that means it was but one part of her perceived baggage. Bernie Sanders severely damaged her campaign. Her general caginess and seeming pathological inability to just be transparent hurt her. And yes, her being a woman that rubbed a lot of people the wrong way hurt her. But, it was the sum of all these things and not on in particular that cost her victory. I think Comey's last minute assist may be the most relevant because we can actually see how undecideds broke heavily for Trump in the final days leading up to the election. And Joe Biden?
